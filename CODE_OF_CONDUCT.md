# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by creating an issue in this repository with the label "conduct". All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## AI-Assisted Development Guidelines

### Our Approach to AI

This MCP server has been developed with significant assistance from AI tools and has been thoroughly reviewed by human developers. We believe in transparency about our development process and want to set clear expectations for our community.

### What This Means

**✅ We Embrace AI as a Development Tool**
- Much of this codebase has been created with AI assistance
- AI tools help us write, debug, and optimize code more efficiently
- We view AI as a powerful development accelerator, not a replacement for human oversight

**⚠️ We Acknowledge AI Limitations**
- Despite thorough review, we expect bugs and issues to arise over time
- AI-generated code requires careful human validation and testing
- No development approach—AI-assisted or traditional—produces perfect code

**🤝 We Welcome Community Contributions**
- We encourage bug reports, feature requests, and improvement suggestions
- Community feedback helps us identify and resolve issues we may have missed
- Your contributions make this project better for everyone

### Contribution Guidelines for AI-Generated Code

**For All Contributors:**
- **Review Requirements**: All code submissions must be thoroughly reviewed before submission, regardless of how they were created
- **AI Usage**: We don't care if your contribution was written with AI assistance—what matters is code quality and correctness
- **Testing Responsibility**: Contributors are responsible for testing their code changes before submission
- **Documentation**: Include clear documentation for any new features or significant changes

**Our Philosophy:**
> AI is a tool—a very powerful one—but it cannot completely create bug-free and problem-free code. Human review, testing, and validation remain essential for quality software development.

**Quality Standards:**
- All code must be readable and maintainable
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Include appropriate error handling
- Consider edge cases and potential failure modes
- Test thoroughly in realistic scenarios

### Reporting AI-Related Issues

If you encounter issues that you suspect may be related to AI-generated code:
- Report them the same way as any other bug
- Provide detailed reproduction steps
- Include context about your environment and usage
- Don't worry about whether the issue stems from AI code—focus on the problem itself

### Community Support

We're committed to:
- **Transparency** about our development process
- **Responsiveness** to community feedback and bug reports
- **Continuous improvement** based on real-world usage and feedback
- **Collaboration** with contributors who want to help make this project better

Remember: Great software is built by communities, not just code generators. Your human insight, testing, and feedback are invaluable to this project's success.
